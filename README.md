## What's CryptoDappy?

CryptoDappy is the fastest way to get started with blockchain development on Flow. Our [learning hub](https://d3em6h2gy0mctd.cloudfront.net/) offers various mission-based scenarios, in which you will build your own full-stack blockchain application that allows for querying, minting and transfering NFTs. You will also learn how to sell these NFTs in packs for a given price of FUSD (Flow's first stablecoin). The NFTs of this application are Dappies, cute little monsters that come with different stripes, rarities and colors. 

The missions of this course are:

* Onboarding: Getting started
* Mission #1: Authentication
* Mission #2: Scripts
* Mission #3: Collections and NFTs
* Mission #4: FUSD and Fungible Tokens
* Mission #5: Minting

By the end of this course, you will have build your own NFT application that looks like the [demo application of CryptoDappy](https://demo.cryptodappy.com/), and deploy it to Flow's testnet. You'll be ready to write, test and deploy your own blockchain applications on Flow.
